# HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds) Index

Now that we built NSW indexes in the previous chapter, we can now have multiple layers of NSW indexes and add hierarchy to the index structure to make it more efficient.

The list of files that you will likely need to modify:

```
src/include/storage/index/hnsw_index.h
src/storage/index/hnsw_index.cpp
```
