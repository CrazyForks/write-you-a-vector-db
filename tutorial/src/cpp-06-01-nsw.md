# NSW (Navigable Small Worlds) Index


Before building the so-called HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds) index, we will start with the basic component of the HNSW index -- NSW (Navigable Small Worlds). In this chapter, we will build a graph-based index structure for vectors.

The starter code for this part is ready but the write-up is still working-in-progress.

The list of files that you will likely need to modify:

```
src/include/storage/index/hnsw_index.h
src/storage/index/hnsw_index.cpp
```
