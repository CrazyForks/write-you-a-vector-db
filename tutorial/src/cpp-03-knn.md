# Naive K-Nearest Neighbors

In this task, we will implement a naive k-nearest neighbor search by simply scanning the table, computing the distance, and retrieving the k-nearest elements.

The list of files that you will likely need to modify:

```
src/execution/sort_executor.cpp                      (KEEP PRIVATE)
src/execution/topn_executor.cpp                      (KEEP PRIVATE)
src/execution/limit_executor.cpp                     (KEEP PRIVATE)
src/include/execution/executors/sort_executor.h      (KEEP PRIVATE)
src/include/execution/executors/topn_executor.h      (KEEP PRIVATE)
src/include/execution/executors/limit_executor.h     (KEEP PRIVATE)
src/optimizer/sort_limit_as_topn.cpp                 (KEEP PRIVATE)
```

**WARNING:** Some part of this chapter overlaps with the CMU-DB's Database System course and we ask you NOT to put the above files in a public repo.

## 

order by executor

limit executor

## Bonus

Top-n optimizer rule and top-n executor.
